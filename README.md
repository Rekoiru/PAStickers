# PAStickers
Templates Stickers for PokeAlarm, can be used on PoracleJS probably but I don't use it so, test it yourself.

PokeAlarm compatible set of stickers, dunno if this works on another webhook like PoracleJS.
I will try to keep it updated, be warned that I will change the folder name inside Pokemon when the time comes.

Based on [nileplumb](https://github.com/nileplumb/PkmnHomeIcons)

# Usage
You can use this stickerset by putting the correct format on your front-end.
Example PokeAlarm: ```"sticker_url": "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Rekoiru/PAStickers/main/Pokemon/{date}/pokemon_icon_<mon_id_3>_<form_id_2>.webp"```

Where ```{date}``` is the date when I update the folder.

It will be updated only if they release new shiny so keep it in mind as a reminder to check if everything is fine on both ends.

I just do this way to refresh Telegram image cache, this is the only way to do so. Feel free to use it or not :D
