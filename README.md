Templates Stickers for PokeAlarm

PokeAlarm compatible stickers, dunno if this works on another webhook like Poracle or something.
I will try to keep it updated, we warned that I will change the folder name inside Pokemon to the current update time so Telegram cache will reset.

# Usage
You can use this stickerset by putting the correct format on your front-end.
Example: "sticker_url":"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Rekoiru/PAStickers/main/Pokemon/{date}/pokemon_icon_<mon_id_3>_<form_id_2>.webp",
Where {date} is the current date of the folder, it will be updated only if they release new shiny so keep it in mind as a reminder.

I just do this way to refresh Telegram cache, this is the only way. You are free to use it or not :D
